# Shoreline Detection Project
The products developed here would not be possible with the data provided by the Web Camera Observation Network ([WebCOOS](https://webcoos.org/))

Using the tools in this project, such as video processing and image/json request, requires an API key to access certain features.

A WebCOOS API key can be obtained for free by registering [here](https://webcoos.org/docs/doc/access/#registering).

The API key, if needed, can be stored as a environment varibale name **WebCOOS** or copy/pasted and added locally to the `webcoos_request.py` file.
